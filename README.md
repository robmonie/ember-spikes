# Ember Tools

At this stage this is a very alpha and incomplete validation framework and form wizard view with validation integration. This has been ported from a basic application that was developed in coffeescript so the javascript has been converted automatically at this stage. I'll tidy this up over time.

##How to build

The build tools and project structure are based largely on Ember.js for consistency and to save me the trouble of getting this setup. Thanks!

1. Install ruby 1.9.2+
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `bundle install`
4. `rake dist`

This will create a number of js files under the 'dist' folder. The easiest one to get started with is ember-tools.js. I'll document to purpose/usage of the others once i've cleaned things up.
