# Ember Tools

At this stage this is a very alpha and incomplete validation framework and form wizard view with validation integration. This has been ported from a basic application developed in coffeescript so the js has been converted automatically at this stage.

Docs and examples to come.

Build tools and project structure are based largely on Ember.js for consistency.
